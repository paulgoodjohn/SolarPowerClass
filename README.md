# SolarPowerClass
These are the class notes and supporting material for the class taught to engineers at GE Appliances during engineering week. The class is intended to give a broad overview of the tools and materials that are available but doesn't presume much actual technical knowledge. The class has been taught now for several years, and it evolves each time and as new information is found.

All the stuff in here is freely available for anyone to use - likewise, if anyone out there in the wider internet world has stuff that isn't here please submit the changes you would like via a pull request (the tab above). Feel free to clone this, look at all the documents and please, have a go. The worst thing that could happen is the world gets to be a little bit better :)
